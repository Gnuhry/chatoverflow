# Chat Overflow
Chat Overflow is a framework to enable better interaction in livestream events by connecting several inputs and outputs, e.g. chat messages, sub notifications and screen overlays.
The software is developed by three computer science students @ [KIT, Karlsruhe](http://www.kit.edu/) and is headed by [skate702](http://skate702.de). For more information please visit http://codeoverflow.org.

## Chat Overflow Framework
The framework contains all information to connect to livestream inputs and outputs. Combined with the [API Project](https://github.com/codeoverflow-org/chatoverflow-api), plugins can be executed. They provide defined behavior, e.g. the [public plugins](https://github.com/codeoverflow-org/chatoverflow-plugins).

### Getting Started

Start with the [Installation](https://github.com/codeoverflow-org/chatoverflow/wiki/Installation). Then learn more about the [CLI](https://github.com/codeoverflow-org/chatoverflow/wiki/Using-the-CLI).

You can find [here](https://github.com/codeoverflow-org/chatoverflow/wiki/The-initialization-process) a brief documentation on the framework processes.

### Development

Please see the wiki to learn how to code new [platform sources](https://github.com/codeoverflow-org/chatoverflow/wiki/Adding-a-new-platform-source) and new [plugins](https://github.com/codeoverflow-org/chatoverflow/wiki/Writing-a-plugin).
